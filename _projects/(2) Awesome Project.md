# The e-vote Project

The Movies Project is something like [**nVotes**](https://nvotes.com/elections-online-voting-tool/?medium=adwords&campaignid=1935804200&adgroupid=73346858760&creative=378247989539&keyword=online%20voting&matchtype=b&adposition=&network=g&device=c&devicemodel=&gclid=CjwKCAjwjuqDBhAGEiwAdX2cj-LWlPWgGBY3_sJ9op0YvhQNEodOyrRFqfnRxp185Ph-qaXaK37-rxoCar0QAvD_BwE), the only difference is that **it does not provide a magic link for voters**! Users are added by the organization before they do any kind of voting. This is suitable for organizations that usually have elections at some specific period.
